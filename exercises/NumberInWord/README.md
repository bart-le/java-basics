Write a method called **`printNumberInWord`**. The method has **one parameter** **`number`** which is the whole number. The method needs to print **_ZERO_**, **_ONE_**, **_TWO_**, ... **_NINE_**, **_OTHER_** if the int parameter number is **0**, **1**, **2**, ... **9** or **other** for any other number including negative numbers. You can use if-else statement or switch statement whatever is easier for you.

**NOTES:**

* Method **`printNumberInWord`** needs to be **`public static`** for now, we are only using **`static`** methods.
* Do not add **`main`** method to solution code.
